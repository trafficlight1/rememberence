    text: 'Regular technical inspections of fishing boats are essential for several reasons. Firstly, they ensure the safety of everyone on board by identifying and addressing potential hazards or malfunctions in key systems such as the engine, steering mechanism, and electrical equipment. Secondly, these inspections help preserve the value of the boat over time by promptly identifying and resolving issues or damages, thus maintaining its seaworthiness and resale value. Additionally, by minimizing the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns or failures during fishing expeditions, these inspections contribute to maximizing productivity, allowing fishermen to focus on their activities without disruptions. Finally, adherence to regulatory standards governing the maintenance and safety of watercraft, including boats used for fishing, is ensured through regular technical inspections, helping boat owners avoid potential fines or penalties while promoting overall maritime safety.',
